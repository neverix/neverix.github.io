# The new decade

Many people thought the new decade started in January 2020. However, if you consider the fact
that the year numbers started from 1 A.D., it can be seen that the decade will actually start
in a few days.

What does this mean? Actually, not that much. In fact, no one probably cares about this little fact,
but with the planets aligning, maybe it really is a new beginning after the false start in 2020.
