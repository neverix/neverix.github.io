excerpt: One sketch a day challenge
---

Starting from today, the 19th of May (Wednesday), I will implement one algorithm per day, visual or other, and share the source code.

# Day 1
[Atom Visualisation](https://editor.p5js.org/neverik/sketches/ZKPIINchE).

# Day 2
[Spinning Cube](https://editor.p5js.org/neverik/sketches/2sLZg6jZ-). I couldn't figure out how to make the box spin vertically so the result looks weird.

# Day 3
[Bouncing Balls](https://editor.p5js.org/neverik/sketches/NWuNKn2sc).

I started with one ball with simple acceleration and collision physics and then added more balls and wind. The hardest part was writing the collision resolution between balls, and I'm still not confident that it's 100% right.
