## Programming

I am a programmer with a game programming background. I have
two Github accounts, before and after a brand change. Most
of the important projects on the old profile are on the front
page.

-   [New Github account](https://github.com/neverix/)

### Game Jams

I have participated in many game jams over the years. Most
of my jam games were made for Ludum Dare and Mini Jam.

### Hackathons

So far, I have participated in two offline hackathons and the
COVID-19 global hackathon.

#### MIT Reality Hack

Together with my team, I made an XR project named draft360
in two days. We won the Best of AR and Best in Tools awards.
I worked on the WebXR frontend and backend.

#### MLHack 2020

I participated primarily online. We won first place in sales forecasting
using a custom SVM-based model.

#### COVID-19 Global Hackathon

I started gathering information about my family a year ago
and found it hard to organise and visualise. I decided to
participate in the COVID-19 Global hackathon and create a
tool that makes it simple to create family trees and learn
`pysimplegui`.

### Projects

This is a quick summary of the projects on my Github. To see a
full list, please look at my profile.

#### Evolution simulator

I created two evolution simulators (EVO and EVO 3.0) as a school
project in late 2017. They are available at [neverik/evo](https://github.com/neverik/evo)
and [neverik/evo3.0](https://github.com/neverik/evo_3.0).

{% include img.html url="portfolio/evo.png" description="First version" %}
{% include img.html url="portfolio/evo3.png" description="Third version" %}

#### Raytracing

I made a path tracing-based renderer in the summer of 2019.
Its source code is [available](https://github.com/neverix/pathcaster)
on Github.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/render.png" description="A test render." %}

#### Arcane Algorithm Archive

I participated in the development of AAA, a book which
aims to be an archive of important algorithms and their
implementations in different languages. In particular, I have
contributed Smalltalk implementations and a Python-based
alternative for the official build system, based on an outdated
version of [gitbook](https://gitbook.io). The original book
can be accessed at [algorithm-archive.org](https://algorithm-archive.org).
My own version is on [my Github](https://github.com/neverix/aaa-py).

Here's a [discussion](https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive/issues/611)
about the build system.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/aaapy.png" description="aaa-py" %}

#### Russian AI Cup

In November-December 2018, I participated in a competition
named Russian AI Cup (RAIC). I made several solutions for it
and contributed some packaged to the Python Dockerfile.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/codeball.jpg" description="RAIC 2018: CodeBall" %}

#### Deep Learning

Some deep learning/artificial intelligence projects I made in summer 2018.

##### Autoencoding

Experiments with using a special type of neural network (Autoencoders)
to create procedural animations. I didn't find any useful applications for
the technology, but I found the results interesting. The source code can be found
[on my Github](https://github.com/Neverik/autoencoding).

{% include img.html url="portfolio/autoenc.png" description="Animation results" %}

##### Financial prediction

A simple LSTM-based financial prediction model. I'm not sure if it's
useful, but it's there and achieves 80% accuracy on training data.
[Source code](https://github.com/Neverik/finance).

##### Evolutionary algorithms

Since EVO 1.0 and 2.0 failed, maybe neural network-based evolutionary
simulators don't even work? I tried making one, but it didn't learn.
[Source code](https://github.com/Neverik/evolution).

#### Processing and Android

[Processing](https://processing.org) is a creative coding
environment. I have used it on my Android phone during the
2017-2018 school year to create several sketches like games,
simulations and generative art. The source code is available
at [neverik/android-processing](https://github.com/Neverik/android-processing)
for Android sketches and [neverik/processing](https://github.com/Neverik/processing)
for Processing ones.

#### VR Caterpillar Simulator

This is my first VR project. I never finished it, but at
least it exists. It's a "Caterpillar Simulator" VR game
for mobile devices. I created it using the Unity game engine.
It was made mostly in summer 2017. One of the lessons I learned
was to never rely on pre-made assets for 3D models, because the
game turned out having no consistent art style. The (unfinished) source
code is available at [neverik/vr](https://github.com/Neverik/vr).

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/start.png" description="" %}
The start of the game. The player can look down to walk and has to eat...
Mushrooms? So they don't starve.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/boat.png" description="" %}
The boat minigame. The player has to steer a boat (actually, it was
intended as a wooden chip, but I ended up calling it a boat in the
scripts).

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/boatend.png" description="" %}
Near the end of the boat minigame, the player approaches a tree. Then the game
makes them jump out of the boat onto the ground. After playtesting this
part, I learned another lesson: never control the player's movement in a VR
game.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/nospider.png" description="" %}
Now the player has to reach the tree, climb up and become a butterfly. Oh no!
A spider approaches the player and blocks their way to the tree! Looks like
its model didn't load.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/questions.png" description="" %}
It starts asking questions. I didn't make up the questions themselves, but they
would probably be some generic trivia stuff.

{% include img.html url="portfolio/caterpillar/tree.png" description="" %}
After the player answers the spider's questions, the spider jumps out into
the nothingness and frees the path. Since the spider model didn't load,
it looks like the collider stopping the player still exists. If that didn't
happen, the player would climb up their tree (again, out of their control),
turn into a butterfly and get chased by a bird - which is the last thing
I made.

#### Equation solver

In the end of the 2018-2019 school year, students of the 7A class had
to make a project in their speciality of interest and then present it
to the class. Since we studied linear equations in our algebra class,
I decided to make a linear equation solver as a project. The source
code is available at [neverix/equsolve](https://github.com/neverix/equsolve)
and a live demo is on [Github Pages](https://neverix.github.io/equsolve).

{% include img.html url="portfolio/equsolve/params.png" description="Parameters for the solver" %}
{% include img.html url="portfolio/equsolve/result.png" description="A detailed solution" %}

#### Cheese

When I was researching chess AI in the end of 2019, I found several games
in the chess algebraic notation. I don't play chess, so it was hard for
me to read them. I decided to make a chess game visualizer and called it
Cheese. The source code is at [neverix/cheese](https://github.com/neverix/cheese)
and a live demo is on [Github Pages](https://neverix.github.io/cheese).
