## Programming
I am a programmer with a game programming background. I have
two Github accounts, before and after a brand change. Most
of the important projects on the old profile are on the front
page.

### Projects
This is a quick summary of the projects on my Github. To see a
full list, please look at my profile.

#### Evolution simulator
I created two evolution simulators (EVO and EVO 3.0) as a school
project in late 2017. They are available at [neverik/evo](https://github.com/neverik/evo)
and [neverik/evo3.0](https://github.com/neverik/evo_3.0).

#### Raytracing
I made a path tracing-based renderer in the summer of 2019.
Its source code is [available](https://github.com/neverix/pathcaster)
on Github.
