## Programming
I am a programmer with a game programming background. I have
two Github accounts, before and after a brand change. Most
of the important projects on the old profile are on the front
page.

* [Old Github account](https://github.com/neverik/)
* [New Github account](https://github.com/neverix/)

### Game Jams
I have participated in many game jams over the years. Most
of my jam games were made for Ludum Dare and Mini Jam.

### Projects
This is a quick summary of the projects on my Github. To see a
full list, please look at my profile.

#### Evolution simulator
I created two evolution simulators (EVO and EVO 3.0) as a school
project in late 2017. They are available at [neverik/evo](https://github.com/neverik/evo)
and [neverik/evo3.0](https://github.com/neverik/evo_3.0).

#### Raytracing
I made a path tracing-based renderer in the summer of 2019.
Its source code is [available](https://github.com/neverix/pathcaster)
on Github.

#### Arcane Algorithm Archive
I participated in the development of AAA, a book which
aims to be an archive of important algorithms and their
implementations in different languages. In particular, I have
contributed Smalltalk implementations and a Python-based
alternative for the official system, based on an outdated
version of [gitbook](https://gitbook.io). The original book
can be accessed at [algorithm-archive.org](https://algorithm-archive.org).
My own version is on [my Github](https://github.com/neverix/aaa-py).

#### Russian AI Cup
In November-December 2018, I participated in a competition
named Russian AI Cup (RAIC). I made several solutions for it
and contributed some packaged to the Python Dockerfile.

#### Deep Learning
Some deep learning/artificial intelligence projects I made in summer 2018.

##### Autoencoding
Experiments with using a special type of neural network (Autoencoders)
to create procedural animations. I didn't find any useful applications for 
the technology, but I found the results interesting. The source code can be found
[on my Github](https://github.com/Neverik/autoencoding).

##### Financial prediction
A simple LSTM-based financial prediction model. I'm not sure if it's
useful, but it's there and achieves 80% accuracy on training data.
[Source code](https://github.com/Neverik/finance).

##### Evolutionary algorithms
Since EVO 1.0 and 2.0 failed, maybe neural network-based evolutionary
simulators don't even work? I tried making one, but it didn't learn.
[Source code](https://github.com/Neverik/evolution).

#### Processing and Android
[Processing](https://processing.org) is a creative coding
environment. I have used it on my Android phone during the
2017-2018 school year to create several sketches like games,
simulations and generative art. The source code is available
at [neverik/android-processing](https://github.com/Neverik/android-processing)
for Android sketches and [neverik/processing](https://github.com/Neverik/processing)
for Processing ones.

#### VR Caterpillar Simulator
This is my first VR project.
